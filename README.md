# Final Project Overview
## Overview
In this project, you will use a real-world data set and practice generative AI to create Python codes for data preparation, analysis, and model development.

## Project Scenario
You have been employed as a Data Scientist by a consultancy firm. The firm has a client who is a resale car dealer. They have a special feature on Ford cars, and they want your firm to design a model that can predict the optimum quotation price for the cars in their lot. They provide you with sales data for the past few years. The dataset contains different features of the cars and the price they were sold at.

The tasks assigned to you are as follows:

1. There might be a few duplicate entries and a few missing values in the dataset. Data cleaning will be a part of the assignment.
2. You must perform exploratory data analysis to draw keen insights on the data and determine the effect of different features on the price. Some specific requests by the client include:

   a.  Identify the number of sales for each fuel type
    b. Identify which transmission type has more price outliers
4. Compare the models with linear, polynomial, and ridge regressions on single and multiple variables to find the best-performing model
5. Perform a Grid Search on the Ridge regression model to identify the optimum hyperparameter of the model for best performance.
## About the data set
This dataset contains resale car sale prices for Ford cars. This public dataset is available on the Kaggle website as the Ford Car Pricing Dataset under the CC0: Public Domain license. The dataset has been slightly modified for the purpose of this project.

Attributes of this dataset have been explained below.

| Variable     | Description                                                             |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Model        | Car model name                                                          |
| year         | Year of car make                                                        |
| transmission | Type of transmission (Automatic, Manual or Semi-Auto)                   |
| fuelType     | The type of fuel the car uses (Petrol, Diesel, Hybrid, Electric, Other) |
| tax annual   | Tax payable in USD                                                      |
| mpg          | Miles per Gallon that the car runs at                                   |
| engineSize   | Engine Size of the car                                                  |
| price        | Price of car in USD                                                     |
## Tasks in the project
The project tasks are data preparation, analysis, and model development. Based on the data set, you must write prompts to generate the Python codes for performing specific tasks. You can access a JupyterLite-based testing environment to test the generated codes using the Generative AI classroom prompts.
